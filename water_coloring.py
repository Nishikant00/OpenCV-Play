# At times it is not possible to replace the color of a pixel by the weighted sum of its neighbors.
# Rather color value at a pixel is repaced by the average of pixels in the neighborhood which also have color similar to the pixel.
# The parameter sigma_r(Sigma_Range) is used for controlling the averaging of dissimilar colors within the neighbourhood.
# It's value range from 0 to 1
# A larger value of sigma_r results in large regions of constant color.
